# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## Authors/Collaborators: Kevin Kipkoech (https://github.com/Kevin7744/monty/)

**About:**

##The Monty language

Monty is a scripting language that is first compiled into byte c code that relies on a stack with specific instructions to manipulate it. However in this language, the task was to create a simple interpreter for monty bytecodes that reads the bytecode file and execute the bytecode commands.

The bytecode files have the .m extension.

##Objectives
* To know what LIFO and FIFO mean
* To know what a stack is, and when to use it
* To know what a queue is, and when to use it
* To know the common implementations of stacks and queues
* To know the most common use cases of stacks and queues
* To know the proper way to use global variables

## General Requirements
* Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**
* All files is compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc**, using the options **-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89**
* All files ends with a new line
* There is **README.md** file at the root of the **alx-low_level_programming**
* Maximum of one global variable is allowed
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The C standard library is allowed
* The prototypes of all the functions were included in the header file called monty.h
* All the header files are include guarded

## Compilation & Output
* These codes were compiled using: ```gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty```
* Any output must be printed on ```stdout```
* Any error message must be printed on ```stderr```
