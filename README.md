## 0x1A-hash_tables
Introduction to Hash Tables in C programming:

Hash tables are data structures that implement an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. They work by transforming the key using a hash function into a hash, which is then used as an index to store or retrieve data. This allows for fast retrieval of data, often with average constant-time complexity, making hash tables efficient for many applications such as database indexing, caches, and symbol tables in compilers. They are applied in scenarios where efficient data retrieval based on keys is required.
Hash tables are implemented using arrays and linked lists or other data structures to handle collisions, where multiple keys map to the same hash value. Techniques like chaining or open addressing are commonly employed to resolve collisions.
