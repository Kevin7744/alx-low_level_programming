# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Description
This repository contains solutions to projects on implementing various search algorithms in C.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder is mandatory
- Code must follow the Betty style
- No global variables allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Only allowed to use the `printf` function of the standard library, no other functions like `strdup`, `malloc`, etc.
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in the `search_algos.h` header file
- Don't forget to push your header file
- All header files should be include guarded

## Tasks
### 0. Linear search
Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm.

### 1. Binary search
Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm.

### 2. Big O #0
Determine the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n.

### 3. Big O #1
Determine the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n.

### 4. Big O #2
Determine the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n.

### 5. Big O #3
Determine the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n.

### 6. Big O #4
Determine the space complexity of a given function / algorithm.
